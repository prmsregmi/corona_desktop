# corona_desktop
A script to automatically load corona data and display in your desktop.

Make sure python is installed on your device.
Install all the dependencies (or in windows run install.bat)
Your internet should also be working.

1st way
Double click corona.pyw

This will run in background and give you stats at top right of your desktop


2nd way
Run corona.py (or in windows run run.bat)


Also, this works great if you have dark themed wallpaper. You have choice to change color, follow the comments. Also there is an option available for the data to be always on top.
