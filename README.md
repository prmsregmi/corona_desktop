# corona_desktop
A script to automatically load corona data and display in your desktop.

There is an executable(exe) already in the repo. You can directly run it.

For running the script itself you can:

Make sure python is installed on your device.
Install all the dependencies (or in windows run install.bat)
Your internet should also be working.
Also, this works great if you have dark themed wallpaper. You have choice to change color, follow the comments. Also there is an option available for the data to be always on top.

1st way
Double click corona_bg.pyw
This will run in background and give you stats at top right of your desktop

2nd way
Run corona.py (or in windows run run.bat)

Note: The data is taken from https://www.worldometers.info/
